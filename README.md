# Image classification using pytorch
It is defined as the task of classifying an image from a fixed set of categories. Many other computer vision challenges such as object detection and segmentation can be reduced to image classification

### Content:
 * imported pytorch libraries
 * used standard models

 Torch and Tochvision have all the required packages to work on image classification and 
 i used custom and standard models with the help of torch.nn
